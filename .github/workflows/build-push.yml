# This action script will take a merge to main and build
# the neuro-san-studio docker image and push it to our ECR.
# It will then update the manifest file with the new tag
# which then will get picked up by our Argo CD system and 
# deploy it to the dev environment.
# In the case of a github Release event, the similar flow
# occurs, but in this case, the staging environment is updated.
# This script does not automatically push anything to production;
# that case is handled manually.
# Note, this script only updates the neuro-san-studio image, while
# the deploy also uses a custom ui image; that process is still 
# manual as the custom ui build is a manual process and not 
# run frequently.
