Joining MileagePlus
Is it free to sign up?

Yes.

Why do you ask for my phone number, gender, and date of birth?

We ask for your gender and date of birth so that your profile follows TSA rules. We may use your number to contact you if the email address in your profile is wrong. Your date of birth must be as it appears on your ID.

Are there non-binary options?

We now offer two non-binary options for gender — Unspecified (X) and Undisclosed (U). The gender selected must match what appears on your government-issued identification.

What name should I enter my account?

Please use the same name that appears on your government-issued identification document, such as a passport or driver's license.

My account
How do I change my name on my account?

There are different processes for making a simple name change or a major change. Find step by step instructions on the Change your MileagePlus information page.

Can I change my email address?

Yes, visit the email settings in your profile and then select Edit to change your email address. Your primary Airline email is the email we will use to contact you about your account or reservations.

Can I combine multiple MileagePlus accounts?

To combine accounts, you must submit a request to merge.

Where can I locate my most recent mileage information?

Your most recent mileage is listed at the top of the My Account page. Miles can take up to 14 business days to credit to your account.

What happens to my existing reservations if I change the name on my account?

You will still be able to check-in, but you may not receive miles for the trip.

We recommend saving your boarding documents and checking your miles after your trip. Mileage posting times are on the Requesting Mileage Credit page.

What should I do if I manage travel for others who have stored miles in my MileagePlus account?

If you manage travel for others, make sure that each traveler has accurate information stored. For example, date of birth, gender and name should match what is on their ID.

Where can I find the latest news and offers for Mileage Plus members?

Find the latest information on the MileagePlus Deals and Offers page.


Account security
What if I forget my MileagePlus number and password?

We will help you find your MileagePlus number using your email address. Once you have your number you can reset your password.

Why am I being prompted to change or verify the name that appears on my MileagePlus account?

To follow TSA rules, the information on your flight reservations must match your ID. The name on your MileagePlus account must also match the name on your reservations. That way we can make sure you receive your miles and other Premier® benefits.

Is it safe to submit credit card information to Airline.com?

We use SSL (Secure Socket Layer) to encrypt your credit card data and protect your information. Other browsers that use SSL include Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari and Firefox.

Learn more about protecting your account.

Award miles and credits
Are there other ways to earn MileagePlus miles besides flying?

You can earn miles in many ways through offers from our partners.

Can I receive credits for trips taken before I had a MileagePlus account?

Yes, under certain circumstances.

If your Airline or Airline Express operated flight was within 6 months before your enrollment, you can still get credit for your miles. Airline flights completed more than 6 months before enrollment are not eligible for accrual. Flights operated by MileagePlus partners are only eligible if flown after you have already enrolled in MileagePlus.

To start the process, request your retro credit. You can also contact the MileagePlus Service Center at 1-800-421-4655 or our international reservations team if you’re outside the U.S. or Canada.

My account is missing mileage credit. What can I do?

You can request credit for miles for Airline-operated and partner flights. The process for requesting credit will depend on your type of flight. Find out how to make a request.

How do I transfer miles or points from other eligible partners into my MileagePlus account?

Miles from programs of other airlines cannot move to your MileagePlus account. For information on how to use these miles, contact the partner airline.
