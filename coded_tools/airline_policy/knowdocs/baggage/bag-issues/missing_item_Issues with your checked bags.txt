1 Report issue
You can report missing items by doing one of the following:
Report it at the airport with the Baggage Service Office
Report it via chat or text "BAGS” to 32050
Report it by calling the Baggage Recovery Center at 1-800-000-0000
(International 1-281-000-0000)
After you report the issue, you'll receive a file reference number that ends in
P (for example: ORD12345P).
If your items went missing during a security screening, you should
file a written claim with the Transportation Security Administration
(TSA). You can also call the TSA Contact Center at 1-866-289-9673.
