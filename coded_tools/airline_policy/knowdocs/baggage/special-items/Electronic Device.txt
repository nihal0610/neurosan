If your device falls or gets stuck in a seat, ask a crew member to help you find it. If the item can’t be found, complete the lost items form.

Follow these safety rules for traveling with lithium batteries:

Completely turn off all devices with lithium-ion batteries that are in checked bags.
Prevent short circuits by protecting battery terminals. This can be done with the manufacturer’s packaging or by covering with tape and placing in a separate bag.
Store spare batteries in carry-on bags.
Lithium-ion batteries can’t exceed 100 watt hours. Lithium metal batteries can’t exceed 2g.
If you’re unsure about the battery, don’t pack it.
