            them by the calling agent.  This dictionary is to be treated as
            read-only.

            The argument dictionary expects the following keys:
                to: List[str],
                attachment_paths: List[str],

        :param sly_data: A dictionary whose keys are defined by the agent
            hierarchy, but whose values are meant to be kept out of the
            chat stream.

            This dictionary is largely to be treated as read-only.
            It is possible to add key/value pairs to this dict that do not
            yet exist as a bulletin board, as long as the responsibility
            for which coded_tool publishes new entries is well understood
            by the agent chain implementation and the coded_tool
            implementation adding the data is not invoke()-ed more than
            once.

            Keys expected for this implementation are:
                agent_name
        :return: successful sent message ID or error message
