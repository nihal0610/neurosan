# Intranet Agents

The **Intranet Agents** is a multi-agent system that mimics the intranet of a major corporation. It allows you to interact
with and get information from various departments such as IT, Finance, Legal, HR, etc. The top-level "front-man" agent
receives a question, and in coordination with down-chain agents, provides an answer.

## Description

Provide the top-level "front-man" agent a question and it will call down-chain agents to determine if they are responsible
for all or part of question. It will then ask those down-chain agents what they need in order to handle their part of the
inquiry. Once the requirements are gathered, the top agent delegates the inquiry and the fulfilled requirements to the
appropriate down-chain agents. Once all down-chain agents respond, the top agent will compile their responses and return
the final response.

The "front-man" agent can call IT, Finance, Procurement, Legal, and HR agents. Those agents, in turn, can call other,
more specific agents. For example, the HR agent can call Benefits or Payroll agents. The agent network has the shape of
a tree that is two layers deep.
