## Prerequisites

- This agent is **disabled by default**. To test it:
  - Manually enable it in the `manifest.hocon` file.
  - Run the MCP server:

    ```bash
    python bmi_server.py
    ```

    Located at: [`bmi_server.py`](../../servers/mcp/bmi_server.py)

## Architecture Overview

### Frontman Agent: **bmi_provider**

- Acts as the entry point for external queries.
- Parses user input and prepares parameters for the tool.
- Integrates tool responses into a final answer.

### Tool: `bmi_calculator`

- Connects to the MCP server using `langchain-mcp-adapters`.
- Sends the request and receives the response.
- Source: [`bmi_calculator.py`](../../coded_tools/mcp_bmi_sse/bmi_calculator.py)

### MCP Server

- Defines tool metadata:
  - **Name**: From function name
  - **Description**: From docstring
  - **Arguments Schema**: From type hints
- Default port: `8000` (can be customized)
- Source: [`bmi_server.py`](../../servers/mcp/bmi_server.py)

## Debugging Hints

Check the following during development or troubleshooting:

- `langchain-mcp-adapters` is installed with a valid version
- MCP server is running
- Client is connected to the correct port
