## Architecture Overview

### Frontman Agent: **PDF RAG Assistant**

* Entry point for user queries.
* Parses the query and routes it to the appropriate tool (`rag_retriever`).
* Collects and composes responses from tools.

### Tool: `rag_retriever`

* Loads PDFs, builds an in-memory vector store, and answers questions based on content.
* Useful when information is embedded in static documents.

#### User-Defined Arguments

##### Required

* `urls` (list): List of PDF URLs to use for RAG.

##### Optional

* `save_vector_store` (bool): Save the vector store to a JSON file.
* `vector_store_path`(str): Path to save/load the vector store (absolute or relative to `neuro-san-studio/coded_tools/pdf_rag/`).

---

## Debugging Hints

Check the following during development or troubleshooting:

* Ensure the **agent** tool is correctly identified as the frontman (no parameters in its function definition).
* Confirm that required arguments (like `query`) are passed correctly.
* Make sure that all URLs are valid.
* Validate vectorstore loading and document parsing for the RAG tool.
* Look at logs to ensure smooth delegation across tool calls and proper response integration.
