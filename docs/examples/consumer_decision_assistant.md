# Consumer Decision Assistant

The **Consumer Decision Assistant** is a multi-agent system that helps consumers with their decisions. This agent network
makes calls to other agent networks from B2C businesses that might not be fully aligned.

**Note**: This agent-network calls other agent networks, which in turn call a web search agent that uses duckduckgo, with
a limited daily search quota.
