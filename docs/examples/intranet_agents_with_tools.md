# Intranet Agents With Tools

The **Intranet Agents With Tools** is a multi-agent system that mimics the intranet of a major corporation. It allows you
to interact with and get information from various departments such as IT, Finance, Legal, HR, etc. The top-level "front-man"
agent receives a question, and in coordination with down-chain agents, provides an answer. Some of the down-chain agents
call coded tools. The HR agent calls the HCM [APIs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/human-resources/25b/farws/index.html).

## Description

Provide the top-level "front-man" agent a question and it will call down-chain agents to determine if they are responsible
for all or part of question. It will then ask those down-chain agents what they need in order to handle their part of the
inquiry. Once the requirements are gathered, the top agent delegates the inquiry and the fulfilled requirements to the
appropriate down-chain agents. Some of the down-chain agents call coded tools. Once all down-chain agents respond, the top
agent will compile their responses and return the final response.

The "front-man" agent can call IT, Finance, Procurement, Legal, HR, and URLProvider agents. Those agents, in turn, can call
other, more specific agents. For example, the HR agent can call Benefits, Payroll, Immigration, and AbsenceManagement agents.
The agent network has the shape of a tree that is multiple layers deep.
