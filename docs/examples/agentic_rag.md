# Agentic RAG Assistant

The **Agentic RAG Assistant** is a modular, multi-agent system designed to answer user queries by intelligently retrieving,
searching, and integrating content from websites, document-based knowledge, and Slack channels. It orchestrates a set of
specialized tools through a central coordinator agent that handles delegation and response synthesis.

This system demonstrates how Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool usage can be seamlessly combined for flexible
enterprise question-answering.

## Description

The assistant is built around a **Front Man** agent that acts as the main point of contact with users. This agent determines
the best course of action—whether it be querying a web search engine, retrieving knowledge from PDF documents, or checking
a Slack channel—and delegates accordingly. The system is structured for scalability, adaptability, and easy integration
into business workflows.

- **Modular Task Delegation**: Tools are independently defined and can be flexibly composed in a graph-based or hierarchical
fashion.
- **Conversational Orchestration**: The front agent abstracts complexity, ensuring users experience a seamless and fluid
interaction.
- **RAG-based Retrieval**: Supports intelligent document Q&A via vectorstore-backed retrieval pipelines.
- **Live Source Access**: Enables up-to-date query resolution via Bing search or Slack message retrieval.

## Architecture Overview

### Frontman Agent: **Agentic RAG Assistant**

- Primary entry point for external user queries.
- Parses the inquiry and determines which tools to invoke.
- Integrates answers from tools to form a cohesive response.

### Supporting Tools

1. **website_search**
   - Powered by `Bing Search` via LangChain.
   - Required an environment variable `BING_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY`.
   - Retrieves up-to-date web results based on the query.
   - Configured to return the top 3 search results.
   - Additional info on [Bing Search](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools/bing_search/).

2. **rag_retriever**
   - Uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline.
   - Accepts a `query` and returns answers based on embedded PDF documents.
   - Useful for answering domain-specific or internal document-based questions.

3. **slack_tool**
   - Interfaces with `slack` to retrieve recent messages from a specified channel.
   - Helpful for referencing ongoing conversations or updates.

## Functional Tools

These tools are independently defined and invoked by the frontman agent:

- **Bing Search Tool (`website_search`)**
  - Retrieves public web data using Bing.
  - Accepts configurable arguments like number of results.

- **RAG PDF Retriever (`rag_retriever`)**
  - Loads a remote PDF, builds an in-memory vectorstore, and answers questions from it.
  - Ideal for scenarios where precise answers are locked inside static documents.

- **Slack Message Retriever (`slack_tool`)**
  - Pulls messages from specified Slack channels.
  - Useful for blending informal organizational context with structured knowledge.

## Debugging Hints

Check the following during development or troubleshooting:

- Ensure the **agent** tool is correctly identified as the frontman (no parameters in its function definition).
- Make sure all tools listed under `"tools"` in the frontman agent exist and are loadable.
- Confirm that required arguments (like `query` or `channel_name`) are passed correctly.
- Validate vectorstore loading and document parsing for the RAG tool.
- Look at logs to ensure smooth delegation across tool calls and proper response integration.
