# Real Estate Agent

The **Real Estate Agent** is a multi-agent system that provides help with real estate transaction inquiries. The
top-level "front-man" agent receives a question, and in coordination with down-chain agents, provides an answer. Some of
the down-chain agents call coded tools. For example, the Listing agent calls the Brave search [APIs](https://brave.com/search/api/).

## Description

Provide the top-level "front-man" agent a question and it will call down-chain agents to determine if they are
responsible for all or part of question. It will then ask those down-chain agents what they need in order to handle their
part of the inquiry. Once the requirements are gathered, the top agent delegates the inquiry and the fulfilled requirements
to the appropriate down-chain agents. Some of the down-chain agents call coded tools. Once all down-chain agents respond,
the top agent will compile their responses and return the final response.

The "front-man" agent can call Buyer, Seller, and Listing agents. Those agents, in turn, can call other, more specific
agents. For example, the Buyer agent can call the Listing, Appraiser, Mortgage, Inspection, and Legal agents. The agent
network has the shape of a tree that is multiple layers deep.
