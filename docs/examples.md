streamable http to calculate BMI. It serves as an example of how to connect to MCP servers in coded tools.

**Tags:** `tool`, `MCP`

### A2A RESEARCH REPORT

[A2A RESEARCH REPORT](./examples/a2a_research_report.md) is an agent that uses a coded tool as an A2A client to connect
to crewAI agents in an A2A server to write a report on a provided topic. This is an example of how to link
neuro-san with other agentic frameworks.

**Tags:** `tool`, `A2A`, `CrewAI`

### PDF RAG Assistant

[PDF RAG Assistant](./examples/pdf_rag.md) is an agent-based system that answers user queries by retrieving information
from specified PDF files using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It processes input through a frontman agent and a
PDF retrieval tool, enabling accurate responses from static documents.

**Tags:** `tool`, `RAG`

### Confluence RAG Assistant

[Confluence RAG Assistant](./examples/confluence_rag.md) answers user queries using RAG over Confluence pages by loading
page content (and optional attachments), building a vector store, and retrieving relevant info to respond.

**Tags** `tool`, `RAG`

### Agentic RAG Assistant

[Agentic RAG Assistant](./examples/agentic_rag.md) is a modular multi-agent system that answers user queries by
retrieving information from the web, PDF documents, and Slack channels. It mimics a smart assistant that delegates tasks
to specialized tools and compiles responses into clear, helpful answers.

**Tags:** `tool`, `API`, `RAG`

## üè¢ Industry-Specific Examples

Examples tailored to specific industry applications.
