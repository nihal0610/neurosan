## What is Neuro SAN?

[**Neuro AI system of agent networks (Neuro SAN)**](https://github.com/cognizant-ai-lab/neuro-san) is an open-source,
data-driven multi-agent orchestration framework designed to simplify and accelerate the development of collaborative AI
systems. It allows users‚Äîfrom machine learning engineers to business domain experts‚Äîto quickly build sophisticated
multi-agent applications without extensive coding, using declarative configuration files (in HOCON format).

Neuro SAN enables multiple large language model (LLM)-powered agents to collaboratively solve complex tasks, dynamically
delegating subtasks through adaptive inter-agent communication protocols. This approach addresses the limitations inherent
to single-agent systems, where no single model has all the expertise or context necessary for multifaceted problems.

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **üóÇÔ∏è Data-Driven Configuration**: Entire agent networks are defined declaratively via simple HOCON files, empowering
technical and non-technical stakeholders to design agent interactions intuitively.
* **üîÄ Adaptive Communication ([AAOSA Protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/9812015))**: Agents autonomously determine how
to delegate tasks, making interactions fluid and dynamic with decentralized decison making.
* **üîí Sly-Data**: Sly Data facilitates safe handling and transfer of sensitive data between agents without exposing it
directly to any language models.
* **üß© Dynamic Agent Network Designer**: Includes a meta-agent called the Agent Network Designer ‚Äì essentially, an agent
that creates other agent networks. Provided as an example with Neuro SAN, it can take a high-level description of a
use-case as input and generate a new custom agent network for it.
* **üõ†Ô∏è Flexible Tool Integration**: Integrate custom Python-based "coded tools," APIs, databases, and even external
agent ecosystems (Agentforce, Agentspace, CrewAI, MCP, A2A agents, LangChain tools and more) seamlessly into your agent workflows.
* **üìà Robust Traceability**: Detailed logging, tracing, and session-level metrics enhance transparency, debugging, and
operational monitoring.
* **üåê Extensible and Cloud-Agnostic**: Compatible with a wide variety of LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Ollama,
etc.) and deployable in diverse environments (local machines, containers, or cloud infrastructures).

## Getting Started

To dive into Neuro SAN and start building your own multi-agent networks, this repository contains a collection of demos
for the [neuro-san library](https://github.com/cognizant-ai-lab/neuro-san).

You'll find comprehensive documentation, example agent networks, and tutorials to guide you through your first steps.

---

### Installation

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cognizant-ai-lab/neuro-san-studio
```

Go to dir:

```bash
cd neuro-san-studio
```

Ensure you have a supported version of python (3.12 at this time):

```bash
python --version
```

Create a dedicated Python virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Source it:

* For Windows:

  ```cmd
  .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat && set PYTHONPATH=%CD%
  ```

* For Mac:

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate && export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`
  ```

Install the requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**IMPORTANT**: By default the server relies on OpenAI's `gpt-4o` model. Set the OpenAI API key, and add it to your shell
configuration so it's available in future sessions.

You can get your OpenAI API key from <https://platform.openai.com/signup>. After signing up, create a new API key in the
API keys section in your profile.

**NOTE**: Replace `XXX` with your actual OpenAI API key.  
**NOTE**: This is OS dependent.

* For macOS and Linux:

  ```bash
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="XXX" && echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="XXX"' >> ~/.zshrc
  ```

* For Windows:
  * On Command Prompt:

    ```cmd
    set OPENAI_API_KEY=XXX
    ```

  * On PowerShell:

    ```powershell
    $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="XXX"
    ```

Other providers such as Anthropic, AzureOpenAI, Ollama and more are supported too but will require proper setup.
Look at the `.env.example` file to set up environment variables for specific use-cases.

### Run

There are multiple ways in which we can now use the neuro-san server with a client:

#### Option 1: Using [`nsflow`](https://github.com/cognizant-ai-lab/nsflow) as a developer-oriented web client

If you want to use neuro-san with a FastAPI-based developer-oriented client, follow these steps:

* Start the server and client with a single command, from project root:

  ```bash
  python -m run
  ```

* As a default
  * Frontend will be available at: `http://127.0.0.1:4173`
  * The client and server logs will be saved to `logs/nsflow.log` and `logs/server.log` respectively.

* To see the various config options for this app, on terminal

  ```bash
  python -m run --help
  ```

#### Option 2: Using a basic web client interface

A [basic web client interface](https://github.com/cognizant-ai-lab/neuro-san-web-client) is installed by default.
It's a great, simple example of how to connect to a neuro-san server and interact with it.
Start the server and the client in one single command:

```bash
python -m run --use-flask-web-client
```

The client and server logs will show on the screen,
and will also be saved to `logs/server.log` and `logs/client.log` respectively.
As a default, on a web browser you can now navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:5003/> to start using the application.

Notes:

1. Expand the `Configuration` tab at the bottom of the interface to connect to the neuro-san server host and port
2. Choose an Agent Network Name, e.g. "music_nerd", click Update  
   This Agent Network Name should match the list of agent networks that are activated in the `registries/manifest.hocon`
   file.
3. Type your message in the chat box and press 'Send' to interact with the agent network.
4. Optional: open the `Agent Network Diagram` tab to visualize the interactions between the agents.
5. Optional: open the `Agent Communications` tab to see the messages exchanged between the agents.

---

#### Option 3: Command Line Interface

You can also use [neuro-san](https://github.com/cognizant-ai-lab/neuro-san)'s command line interface (CLI) to start and
interact with the server.

* Export the following environment variables:

  ```bash
  # Point the server to the manifest file containing the agent network configurations
  export AGENT_MANIFEST_FILE="./registries/manifest.hocon"
  # Point the server to the directory containing the agent Python tools
  export AGENT_TOOL_PATH="./coded_tools"
  ```

* For further instructions, refer to the client/server [setup](https://github.com/cognizant-ai-lab/neuro-san/blob/main/README.md#clientserver-setup)
in neuro-san.
