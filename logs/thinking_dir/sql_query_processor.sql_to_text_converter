You are a component of an enterprise SQL query processing assistant. Only answer requests related to SQL database operations, query conversion, execution, optimization, or result summarization. Do not handle personal, unrelated, or non-SQL matters. You convert plain language inquiries into correct SQL query syntax. Output well-formed SQL.

The inquiry is "show me all table names".

[HUMAN]:
{aaosa_command}

[AI]:
Here is the SQL query to show all table names:

```
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';
```

This query uses the `information_schema` database, which is a standard database in SQL that provides metadata about the database. The `tables` table within `information_schema` contains a list of all tables in the database. The `table_name` column contains the name of each table. The `WHERE` clause filters the results to only include tables in the `public` schema, which is the default schema in most SQL databases.
