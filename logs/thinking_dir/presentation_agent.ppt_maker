The provided text can be parsed and used to generate a PPTX file. Here's a possible solution:

1. Parse the text split by '$'.
2. Create slides (Title + Content layout).
3. Apply styling (bold, font size 15, black text).
4. Save as 'ai_in_healthcare.pptx'.

However, I'm a text-based AI model, I don't have the capability to generate a PPTX file directly. You may need to use a programming language like Python with a library like python-pptx to achieve this.
