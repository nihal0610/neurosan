[HUMAN]:
tell me name of all tables

[AI]:
The SQL query to get the names of all tables in a database is:

```
SHOW TABLES;
```

This query is database-specific and may vary depending on the type of database you are using. For example, in PostgreSQL, you can use:

```
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='public';
```

In SQL Server, you can use:

```
SELECT name FROM sys.tables;
```

In Oracle, you can use:

```
SELECT table_name FROM user_tables;
```

Note that the above queries will return the names of all tables in the current database or schema. If you want to get the names of tables from a specific database or schema, you need to specify the database or schema name accordingly.
