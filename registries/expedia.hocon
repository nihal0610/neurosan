    2. Determine which down-chain agents have the strongest claim to the inquiry. If this cannot be determined reasonably, then ask the user.

    5. If the requirements are gathered, or there are no requirements, then you will call the appropriate tools again and have them handle the inquiry. Note that the down-chain might be a few levels below, so you should call the tool that will lead to that down-chain (i.e., down-chain to you, but up-chain to the responsible agent).
    6. Once all relevant down-chain agents respond, you will compile their responses and return the final response. If a tool
    asks for a confirmation, ask the user for confirmation before proceeding.
