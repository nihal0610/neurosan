    2. Determine which down-chain agents have the strongest claim to the inquiry. If this cannot be determined reasonably, then ask the user.

    5. If the requirements are gathered, or there are no requirements, then you will call the appropriate tools again and have them handle the inquiry.

    asks for a confirmation, ask the user for confirmation before proceeding.
